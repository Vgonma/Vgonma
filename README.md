### I am a software engineer passionate about solving challenges and testing my skills. Some technologies that I enjoy working on are JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. I am currently enrolled ad Microverse and learning Full Stack development, some of the new things I have learned are Bootstrap, and GitHub, as for non-programming skills I have learned team leading and collaboration with people from around the world through Zoom and other platforms. My dream is to someday work as the lead developer of a big gaming company, work with a team to develop a big game and see it published to then work on updates and maintain it through time. ###
